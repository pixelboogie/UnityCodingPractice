/*
Write a script that, when attached to a game object, 
allows the player to move the object around the scene using keyboard input. 
The object should move forward, backward, left, and right, and the movement speed 
should be adjustable in the Unity editor. The movement should be smooth and continuous, 
without any sudden stops or jumps. Additionally, the object should be prevented from 
moving outside a specified boundary area in the scene.
