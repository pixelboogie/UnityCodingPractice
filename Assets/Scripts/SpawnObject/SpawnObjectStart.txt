/*
Write a script that spawns a new game object at a random location in the scene every few seconds. The new game object should have a random color and should move upwards until it reaches a certain height, at which point it should be destroyed. Additionally, the script should keep track of the player's score, which increases every time a game object is destroyed. The score should be displayed on the screen using a UI text element.
